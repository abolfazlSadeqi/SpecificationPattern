# Specification Pattern Example Project

This project is designed as a simple and straightforward example to understand the Specification pattern in software design. It includes two sub-projects, each demonstrating the implementation of the Specification pattern in different contexts.

## Sub-projects

### 1. Clean Architecture with Specification Pattern using LINQ
This sub-project demonstrates how to implement the Specification pattern within a Clean Architecture setup, utilizing LINQ for data querying. 

Path:Clean

### 2. Specification Pattern without LINQ
The second sub-project shows how the Specification pattern can be implemented without the use of LINQ.

## Overview of the Specification Pattern

is a particular software design pattern, 
whereby business rules can be recombined by chaining the business rules together using bool logic. 

The pattern is frequently used in the context of domain-driven design.


   In this pattern, a unit of business logic inherits its functionality from the abstract aggregate Composite Specification class
The specification pattern helps to encapsulate a piece of domain knowledge into a single unit.
